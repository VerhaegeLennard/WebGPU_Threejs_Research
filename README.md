# WebGPU + Three.js Project

This project is my research on how to implement WebGPU with Three.js

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher recommended)
- **npm**
- A browser that supports WebGPU (e.g., Google Chrome with the `--enable-unsafe-webgpu` flag or any compatible browser)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your device
2. go to the right directory with "cd ./WebGPU_Threejs/""
3. install node modules "npm i"
4. run the project "npm run dev"

You can compare the performace to WebGL by starting the other version in WebGL_Threejs
